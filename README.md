PIPELINE:

2)EDA:
	1. get rid of unwanted features
	2. divide data into dependent and independent features i.e X and Y
	3. check null values
	4. handle categorical features
	5. split dataset into train and test
	6. feature scaling i.e standardization
	7. using keras to fit_transform
	8. plot accuracy and loss
	9. check the score
